# Coca-Cola-Sales-Predection
This project focuses on analyzing historical Coca-Cola sales data and building a predictive model to forecast future sales using Python. The main objective is to understand sales trends, identify key influencing factors, and develop accurate predictions that can assist in business planning and decision-making.

The project begins with data collection and preprocessing, where the raw dataset is cleaned using Pandas and NumPy. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies are handled carefully to ensure data quality. Following this, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify seasonal trends, correlations, and regional sales patterns. Various charts such as line plots, heatmaps, and boxplots are created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize relationships and fluctuations in Coca-Cola sales over time.

After the exploratory phase, the project applies machine learning algorithms to predict future sales. Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost are trained and compared based on their performance metrics, including R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The model that achieves the best balance between accuracy and interpretability is selected for final prediction.

A detailed Jupyter Notebook documents every step — from data preparation and visualization to model building and evaluation. The results highlight key factors affecting Coca-Cola’s sales, such as seasonality, promotions, and regional differences, demonstrating how data-driven forecasting can enhance decision-making in the beverage industry.
